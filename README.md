# A prometheus exporter for Satisfactory

This is an exporter for Satisfactory that use [Ficsit Remote Montioring mod](https://ficsit.app/mod/B9bEiZFtaaQZHU) and expose the data in Prometheus compatible.

This work is a fork of the work of [AP-Hunt](https://github.com/AP-Hunt/) on the [Ficsit Remote Monitoring Companion](https://github.com/AP-Hunt/FicsitRemoteMonitoringCompanion) that I have adapted to my usecase.

Basicaly I have removed everything that is not for the exporter, and have added the requirements for building a Docker image from that.
